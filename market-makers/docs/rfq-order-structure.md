# RFQ Order Structure

RFQ orders are a stripped down version of standard [limit orders](../../limit-orders-advanced-traders/docs/limit-order-structure.md), supporting fewer fields and a leaner settlement process. These orders are fielded just-in-time, directly from market makers, during the construction of a swap quote on 0x API, and can be filled through the `fillRfqOrder()` function on the Exchange Proxy.\


Some notable differences from regular limit orders are:

* There is no `sender` field.
* There is no taker fee.
* Must restrict `transaction.origin` via the _order.txOrigin_ field.
* There is currently no protocol fee paid when filling an RFQ order.



The `RFQOrder` struct has the following fields:

| `makerToken`  | `address` | The ERC20 token the maker is selling and the maker is selling to the taker. \[required]                                                                                                                                                                        |
