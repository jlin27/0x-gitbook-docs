# How to Delegate ZRX

To be eligible to vote on a ZEIP or treasury proposal, your ZRX must be staked or delegated. You can delegate to yourself, a staking pool operator, or an existing delegate by doing the following:

1. Go to [https://0x.org/zrx/vote](https://0x.org/zrx/vote) and connect your wallet&#x20;
2. Click on the green button that says Register your ZRX
3. Choose the Register path by clicking on the green button that says Register your ZRX
4. To delegate to yourself, click the green button that says Confirm Registration
5. To delegate to someone else, click where it says Delegate to someone else and then choose from the available options and click the green button that says Choose this new pool
6. Completing step 4 or 5 will require you to approve a transaction in your wallet, which will require a small amount of ETH for gas
