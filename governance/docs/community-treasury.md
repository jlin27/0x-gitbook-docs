# Community Treasury

In the Spring of 2021, the [community treasury](https://0x.org/zrx/treasury) was established with initial seed-funding from 0x Labs. Since then, the Polygon and Celo networks have also made contributions.&#x20;

The purpose of the community treasury is not enforced, and ZRX holders are in control of what to do with the funds. The suggested usage, however, is the funding of projects that benefit the 0x ecosystem and provide positive effects to ZRX holders.&#x20;
