# Governance Participants

The 0x DAO is a community of informed people with skin in the game: ZRX owners, marketmakers, delegates, and other interested parties whose incentives are aligned with the good functioning of the protocol, including an ever-growing network of ecosystem partners using 0x technology in their products and services.&#x20;

By participating in 0x governance, you can suggest ways to put communal funds to work, explore opportunities for the protocol to drive value creation and capture, and vote on key protocol upgrades and parameters.&#x20;

Over time, participating in the act of governance enables stewards to build reputations worthy of delegation and trust; helps to surface and galvanize ideas that would otherwise remain hidden or abstract and unable to be acted on; and also strengthens community bonds that reinforce longevity and resilience.
