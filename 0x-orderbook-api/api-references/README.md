# API References

## Introduction

**The 0x API is the liquidity and data endpoint for DeFi**. It lets you access aggregated liquidity from tens of on-chain and off-chain decentralized exchange networks, across multiple blockchains. It comes with many parameters to customize your requests for your application and your users.

While the 0x Labs Team hosts a version of the 0x API (subject to the [0x Terms of Service](https://0x.org/terms)), all the code is open source and available at the [0x-API GitHub repo](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api). If you run into a problem, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/issues).

We offer hosted versions for different Ethereum networks. Requests for more networks, and questions/feedback in general should be directed at our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/d3FTX3M).\
\
0x API has an Orderbook on the following chains:

| Network             | Endpoint                                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ethereum (mainnet)  | [https://api.0x.org/](https://api.0x.org/)                 |
| Polygon             | [https://polygon.api.0x.org/](https://polygon.api.0x.org/) |
| Binance Smart Chain | [https://bsc.api.0x.org/](https://bsc.api.0x.org/)         |

## Versioning

Each 0x HTTP API `path` is versioned independently using URI versioning. The format is: `https://api.0x.org/<path>/<version>/<endpoint>`.

For example, you can request `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote` which represents `v1` of the `quote` endpoint in the `swap` path. URLs not adhering to this format are not supported.

\
A major version bump occurs whenever a backwards incompatible change occurs to an `endpoint`, in which case every `endpoint` in that `path` will be on the next version. Old versions of the API will be deprecated and new features will be rolled out to them on a best-effort basis.\


## Pagination

\
Requests that return potentially large collections are paginated and respond to the `page` and `perPage` parameters.&#x20;

Any endpoint that follows this convention will display the following:

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">`This endpoint is paginated.`</mark>

And will only document the objects in the `records` field.\
\
By default, a request returns page 1 with 20 orders. It is possible to change which page and how many records are returned per page via the query parameters. For example, to fetch page 3 with 50 records per page:

```
https://api.0x.org/orderbook/v1/orders?page=3&perPage=20
```

#### Request

| Query Param | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page`      | <p>(Optional, defaults to "1") The page index (1-indexed) requested in the collection.<br></p> |
| `perPage`   | (Optional, defaults to "20") The amount of records to return per page. The maximum is "1000".  |

#### Response

| Field     | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page`    | The page index (1-indexed) of returned in the response (same as request if provided). |
| `perPage` | The amount of `records` requested in the pagination, but not necessarily returned.    |
| `total`   | The total amount of `records` in the collection (across all pages).                   |
| `records` | The actual `records` returned for this page of the collection.                        |

If a query provides an unreasonable (ie. too high) `perPage` value, the response can return a validation error as specified in the errors section. If the query specifies a `page` that does not exist (ie. there are not enough `records`), the response will return an empty `records` array.

## Allowance Targets

Some interactions with 0x require or are improved by setting [token allowances](https://tokenallowance.io/), or in other words, giving 0x's smart contracts permission to move certain tokens on your behalf. Some examples include -

* Submitting a 0x API quote selling ERC20 tokens, you will need to give an allowance to the contract address. This address can be found either as the value of `allowanceTarget` returned in the quote response or in the ExchangeProxy Address column in the "Addresses by Network" table below.
* Trading ERC20 tokens using the Exchange contract, you will have to give an allowance to the ERC20Proxy contract.
* **Note:** For swaps with "ETH" as sellToken, wrapping "ETH" to "WETH" or unwrapping "WETH" to "ETH" no allowance is needed, a null address of `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` is then returned instead.

### Addresses by Network

The following table includes commonly used contract addresses. For a full list of our smart contract deployments address, see the[0x-cheat-sheet.md](../../introduction/0x-cheat-sheet.md "mention") .

## Common Objects

This section outlines API JSON objects that are common to many endpoints.

### Signed Order

A [0x Limit Order](https://protocol.0x.org/en/latest/basics/orders.html#limit-orders) with additional fields and ready to be consumed by our tooling and sent to the [0x exchange proxy contract](https://protocol.0x.org/en/latest/architecture/proxy.html).

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maker`               | The address of the party that creates the order. The maker is also one of the two parties that will be involved in the trade if the order gets filled.                                                                     |
| `taker`               | The address of the party that is allowed to fill the order. If set to a specific party, the order cannot be filled by anyone else. If left unspecified, anyone can fill the order.                                         |
| `makerToken`          | The address of the ERC20 token the maker is selling to the taker.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `takerToken`          | The address of the ERC20 token the taker is selling to the maker.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `makerAmount`         | The amount of makerToken being sold by the maker                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `takerAmount`         | The amount of takerToken being sold by the taker                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `expiry`              | Timestamp in seconds of when the order expires. Expired orders cannot be filled.                                                                                                                                           |
| `salt`                | A value that can be used to guarantee order uniqueness. Typically it is set to a random number.                                                                                                                            |
| `feeRecipient`        | The address of the entity that will receive any fees stipulated by the order. This is typically used to incentivize off-chain order relay.                                                                                 |
| `pool`                | The staking pool to attribute the 0x protocol fee from this order. Set to zero to attribute to the default pool, not owned by anyone.                                                                                      |
| `takerTokenFeeAmount` | Amount of takerToken paid by the taker to the feeRecipient.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `sender`              | An advanced field that doesn't need to be set. It allows the maker to enforce that the order flow through some additional logic before it can be filled (e.g., a KYC whitelist) -- more on the ability to extend 0x later. |
| `verifyingContract`   | Address of the contract where the transaction should be sent, usually this is the [0x exchange proxy contract](https://protocol.0x.org/en/latest/architecture/proxy.html).                                                 |
| `chainId`             | The ID of the Ethereum chain where the `verifyingContract` is located.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `signature`           | A JSON object with the signature of the fields above using the private key of `maker`. The fields of the signature object are documented in the table below.                                                               |

### **Signature**

A structured object containing the signature data for the order. For more info see [How to sign](https://protocol.0x.org/en/latest/basics/orders.html#how-to-sign).

| Field           | Description                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `signatureType` | A number representing the signature method used for signing the order, EIP712 (2) and EthSign (3) are supported. |
| `r`             | A hexadecimal string with signature data.                                                                        |
| `s`             | A hexadecimal string with signature data.                                                                        |
| `v`             | An integer number with signature data.                                                                           |

## Misc.

* All requests and responses should be of "application/json" content type.
* All token amounts are sent in amounts of the smallest level of precision (base units). (e.g if a token has 18 decimal places, selling 1 unit of the token would show up as selling `1000000000000000000` base units by this API).
* All addresses are sent as lower-case (non-checksummed) Ethereum addresses with the `0x` prefix.
* All parameters should use **lowerCamelCase.**
