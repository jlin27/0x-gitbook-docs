| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maker`             | The address of the party that creates the order. The maker is also one of the two parties that will be involved in the trade if the order gets filled.                                               |
| `taker`             | The address of the party that is allowed to fill the order. If set to a specific party, the order cannot be filled by anyone else. If left unspecified, anyone can fill the order.                   |
| `makerToken`        | The address of the ERC20 token that the order maker is trying to sell.                                                                                                                               |
| `takerToken`        | The address of the ERC20 token that the taker must trade in exchange for the maker's tokens.                                                                                                         |
| `makerAmount`       | Amount of the maker's tokens being offered by the maker.                                                                                                                                             |
| `takerAmount`       | Amount of the taker's tokens the maker will accept in exchange for their maker tokens. In order to calculate the price the maker is offering, one can divide the `makerAmount` by the `takerAmount`. |
| `expiry`            | Timestamp in seconds of when the order expires. Expired orders cannot be filled.                                                                                                                     |
| `verifyingContract` | The address of the smart contract that will settle the order.                                                                                                                                        |

## Response

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feeRecipient`        | The entity that will receive any fees stipulated by the order. This is typically used to incentivize off-chain order relay. Note that 0x API charges no fees and therefore has no `feeRecipient`.                          |
| `sender`              | An advanced field that doesn't need to be set. It allows the maker to enforce that the order flow through some additional logic before it can be filled (e.g., a KYC whitelist) -- more on the ability to extend 0x later. |
| `takerTokenFeeAmount` | The amount of takerToken to be paid by the taker to the `feeRecipient` in the event of an order fill.                                                                                                                      |
