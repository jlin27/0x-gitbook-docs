# Limit Order Structure

Limit orders are the standard 0x Order, which encodes a possible trade between a maker and taker at a fixed price. These orders are typically distributed `/orderbook`, and can be filled through the functions on the Exchange Proxy.

The `LimitOrder` struct has the following fields:

| Field                 | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
