# üìä How to Get 0x and Matcha Data

\* _updated as of Apr 6, 2023_

This guide introduces the dashboards and tools available to explore 0x data, for different needs. In this piece, we are mainly focusing on ready-made analytics solutions that don‚Äôt require advanced data scraping. The following solutions are ideal for teams working on analytics product or data information sites, looking to integrate 0x data with minimum effort; or for DeFi researchers/analysts looking for ready made, reliable sources about the 0x ecosystem. At the end of the document we provide links to resources for advanced use cases.

## üó∫Ô∏è Scope and Concepts ‚úèÔ∏è

The following resources cover **active** versions of 0x exchange contracts (v2, v3, v4) and API endpoints (v1 `/swap`). Based on the most common use cases, we will introduce how to get data on different layers of the 0x ecosystem, which are defined as follows:

### The DEX Layer - 0x Native

0x Native volume covers orders conforming to one of the 0x Native Order formats (currently two: Limit Order and Rfq Order) and are settled by 0x smart contracts. Orders generated from 0x open order book and RFQ system are settled on them. Besides that, as it‚Äôs an open-source onchain infrastructure that any aggregator can use, 1inch exchange and Tokenlon have actively been using the 0x exchange contracts to settle trades. Thus this portion of volume has an overlap with other aggregators‚Äô volume, but no overlap with other AMM DEXes.

### The Aggregator Layer - 0x API (`/swap` endpoint)

0x API is the endpoint that allows any integrator or individual to fetch available quotes from "makers" to match their own "taker" order.

It is an off-chain order matching system that compares prices across:

* On-chain **bridge liquidity** (30+ AMM pools across chain like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc.)
* Off-chain **native liquidity** from RFQ system with Professional Market Makers‚Äô quotes
* Off-chain **native liquidity** from 0x‚Äôs Open Order Book network (known as mesh, accessed via 0x API `/orderbook` endpoint)

It returns the best price source (or sources) to users and prepares the routing information to be settled on chain ‚Äî by 0x exchange contracts (**native liquidity**) or other DEXes' contracts (**bridge liquidity**).

This portion has an overlap with other DEXes' volume as the bridge liquidity will be settled on their origin DEXes, but there‚Äôs no overlap with other aggregators.

For a list of all sources, see: [What exchange networks does Matcha aggregate liquidity from?](http://help.matcha.xyz/en/articles/4375069-what-exchange-networks-does-matcha-aggregate-liquidity-from)

### The Application Layer - Matcha and other 0x API Integrators

[Matcha](https://matcha.xyz) is a user-facing product sitting on top of 0x API `/swap` and `/orderbook` endpoints. It fetches "maker" order via `/swap` endpoints for consumers‚Äô **market orders**; and submit "maker" order via `/orderbook` endpoints for consumers‚Äô **limit orders** which can later be sourced and potentially filled via `/swap` endpoint. Other integrators work in a similar way, but may include additional sources.

### The Global Total - 0x Protocol

The term 0x Protocol is used to describe the total combined volume covering both 0x DEX layer (0x Native) and aggregator layer (0x API). As we mentioned above, 0x Native liquidity can potentially be "fetched" by 0x API as well, thus there is an overlap between these 2 attributions. We make sure to de-duplicate that part to avoid double counting.

### Summary

Below is a summary table for different attributions:
